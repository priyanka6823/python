## Introduction to Python

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language**. It is known for its **simple syntax and readability**.

### Features:

* Easy to learn and use
* Interpreted language
* Platform independent
* Large standard library
* Supports multiple paradigms

---

## Python Installation & Setup

* Download Python from the official website
* Install Python and add it to PATH
* Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## Python Syntax & Comments

Python uses **indentation** instead of braces `{}`.

### Example:

```python
if True:
    print("Hello Python")
```

### Comments:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""This is a
multi-line comment"""
```

---

## Variables & Data Types

Variables store data values.

```python
x = 10
y = "Python"
z = 5.5
```

### Common Data Types:

* int
* float
* complex
* str
* list
* tuple
* set
* dict
* bool

---

## Type Conversion

Convert one data type into another.

```python
x = "10"
y = int(x)
```

Types:

* int()
* float()
* str()
* list()
* tuple()
* set()

---

## Operators in Python

### Arithmetic Operators

`+  -  *  /  %  **  //`

### Relational Operators

`==  !=  >  <  >=  <=`

### Logical Operators

`and  or  not`

### Assignment Operators

`=  +=  -=  *=`

### Membership Operators

`in  not in`

## Input & Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

## Control Flow Statements (Decision Making & Loops)

Control flow statements control the **execution flow** of a program based on conditions or repetitions.

---

### 🔹 if Statement

Used to execute a block of code when a condition is true.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

---

### 🔹 if-else Statement

Executes one block if condition is true, otherwise another block.

```python
x = 3
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")
```

---

### 🔹 if-elif-else Statement

Used when multiple conditions are involved.

```python
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

## 🔁 Loops in Python

Loops are used to **repeat a block of code multiple times**.


### 🔹 for Loop

Used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string, range).

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

#### for loop with list

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for item in fruits:
    print(item)
```

### 🔹 while Loop

Executes a block as long as the condition is true.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 🔹 Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, j)
```

### 🔹 Loop Control Statements

#### break

Terminates the loop completely.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

#### continue

Skips the current iteration.

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

#### pass

Used as a placeholder.

```python
for i in range(3):
    pass
```

---

### 🔹 else with Loops

Executed when the loop finishes normally.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
```

---

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters.

```python
s = "Python"
print(s[0])
print(s.upper())
```

### String Operations:

* Indexing
* Slicing
* Concatenation
* Methods (`lower()`, `replace()`, `split()`)

---

## Lists

Lists are **mutable and ordered**.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list1.append(5)
```

Common Methods:

* append()
* insert()
* remove()
* pop()
* sort()

## Tuples

Tuples are **immutable and ordered**.

```python
t = (10, 20, 30)
```

---

##  Sets

Sets are **unordered and unique**.

```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
s.add(4)
```

---

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data as **key-value pairs**.

```python
d = {"name": "Alex", "age": 25}
print(d["name"])
```

Methods:

* keys()
* values()
* items()
* get()
* update()

## Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code.

### User-defined Function

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(10, 20))
```

### Types of Arguments

* Positional
* Keyword
* Default
* Variable-length (`*args`, `**kwargs`)

### Lambda Function

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))
```
# Compression in Python
🔹 What is Compression?

Compressionis the process of reducing the size of data so it takes less storage space and can be transferred faster. In Python, compression is often used along with **serialization**, where data structures are converted into a format that can be saved to a file or sent over a network.

🔹 Lists in Compression

A list is an ordered collection of elements.

Example:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

Before compression, lists must be **serialized** (converted into a byte or string format). Serialization makes lists ready for compression and storage.

 🔹 Dictionaries in Compression

A **dictionary** stores data in **key–value pairs**.

Example:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Priyanka", "age": 21}


Like lists, dictionaries cannot be compressed directly. They are first serialized and then compressed.


🔹 Serialization Functions (dump, dumps, load, loads)

Python provides these functions (commonly from `pickle` or `json`) to serialize and deserialize data.

# dump()

* Writes serialized data **directly to a file**
* Used when storing data permanently

Example:

```python
import pickle
with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(my_list, f)

# dumps()

* Converts data into a **bytes object**
* Does not write to a file

Example:

```python
serialized_data = pickle.dumps(my_dict)

# load()

* Reads serialized data **from a file**
* Converts it back to original form

Example:

```python
with open("data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)

#loads()

* Converts serialized **bytes data** back to original data

Example:

```python
data = pickle.loads(serialized_data)

🔹 Why Use dump & load in Compression?

* Helps store compressed data efficiently
* Makes data transferable between programs
* Useful in file storage, networking, and data science

## Summary

| Function | Purpose                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| dump()   | Write serialized data to file |
| dumps()  | Convert data to bytes         |
| load()   | Read data from file           |
| loads()  | Convert bytes back to data    |
